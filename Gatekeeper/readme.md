# Gatekeeper Pattern

The Gatekeeper pattern is a common design pattern used in web applications to control access to resources based on certain conditions or permissions. It acts as a security layer between clients and resources, enforcing authorization and validation rules.

## How it works

The Gatekeeper pattern typically involves the following components:

1. **Client**: The user or application making requests to access resources.
2. **Gatekeeper**: The middleware or server-side component responsible for intercepting requests and enforcing access control rules.
3. **Resource**: The protected resource that requires authentication or authorization.

The flow of the Gatekeeper pattern can be summarized as follows:

1. The client sends a request to access a specific resource.
2. The request is intercepted by the gatekeeper before reaching the resource.
3. The gatekeeper performs authentication and authorization or any other sanitization checks based on predefined rules.
4. If the request passes the checks, the gatekeeper forwards the request to the resource.
5. The resource processes the request and generates a response.
6. The response is sent back to the client through the gatekeeper.

## Benefits of the Gatekeeper Pattern

- **Security**: The Gatekeeper pattern adds an additional layer of security to protect resources by ensuring that only authorized clients can access them.
- **Centralized Control**: By implementing access control logic in the gatekeeper, you can centralize and manage authorization rules and policies for multiple resources.
- **Modularity**: The gatekeeper acts as an intermediary, allowing resources to focus on their core functionality without worrying about authentication and authorization.

## Considerations for Choosing a Gatekeeper Implementation

When choosing a gatekeeper implementation for your application, consider the following factors:

1. **Scalability**: Ensure that the gatekeeper solution can handle the expected traffic and scale as your application grows.
2. **Flexibility**: Look for a gatekeeper implementation that supports different authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and provides flexibility in defining access control rules.
3. **Integration**: Consider the ease of integrating the gatekeeper with your existing application stack, such as frameworks, databases, and other services.
4. **Maintenance and Support**: Evaluate the community support, documentation, and maintenance of the gatekeeper solution to ensure its long-term viability.

## Demo

To demonstrate the Gatekeeper pattern, download the compressed file in this repo and start the application using `node app.js`. You can open the `test.html` in a browser and fire the requests.
`Access Resource` will result provide access to the resource. However `Get Error` will result in `401` error.

## Conclusion

The Gatekeeper pattern provides a powerful mechanism for controlling access to resources in web applications. By implementing a gatekeeper component, you can enhance security, enforce access control rules, and centralize authorization logic. Understanding and applying the Gatekeeper pattern can greatly contribute to building secure and scalable web applications.
