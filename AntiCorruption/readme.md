# Anti-corruption Layer Pattern

The Anti-corruption Layer pattern is a software design pattern that helps isolate a system from external dependencies or legacy systems that are prone to corruption or incompatible with the system's architecture. It acts as a protective layer between the system and external interfaces, allowing the system to function independently and shielding it from the corrupting influence of external factors.

## Overview

The Anti-corruption Layer pattern proposes creating a separate layer or component that acts as a translator or adapter between the system and the external interfaces. This layer shields the internal system from the complexities and corruptions of the external world, allowing the internal architecture to remain intact.

## Problem

When integrating with external systems, especially legacy systems or those with poor data quality or incompatible architectures, the risk of corruption and entanglement increases. It becomes challenging to maintain a clean and robust architecture within the system.

## Solution

The Anti-corruption Layer pattern provides a solution by creating a separate layer that mediates the communication between the internal system and external interfaces. This layer:

- Handles the translation and mapping of incompatible interfaces.
- Performs data transformation and validation.
- Protects the internal system from the complexities and corruptions of external systems.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Anti-corruption Layer pattern typically involves the following components:

1. **Interface Adapters**: These adapters convert the incompatible interfaces of the external systems into a well-defined and standardized interface that the internal system understands. They handle the mapping, data transformation, and communication with the external system.

2. **Domain Models**: The Anti-corruption Layer may introduce domain models that represent the system's core business concepts. These models are independent of the external system's models and help maintain the integrity and consistency of the internal system.

3. **Translation and Validation**: The Anti-corruption Layer performs data translation and validation to ensure that the data flowing between the internal and external systems is clean, consistent, and aligned with the internal system's requirements.

## Benefits

- **Isolation**: The Anti-corruption Layer isolates the internal system from the complexities and corruptions of external systems. It prevents the internal architecture from being influenced or compromised by incompatible or corrupting factors.

- **Maintainability**: By encapsulating the complexities of external systems within the Anti-corruption Layer, it becomes easier to maintain and evolve the internal system independently of the external dependencies.

- **Flexibility**: The Anti-corruption Layer enables the internal system to adapt and evolve without being constrained by the limitations or shortcomings of external systems. It allows for more flexible and agile development.

- **Testability**: With a separate layer for handling external dependencies, testing becomes more manageable. The Anti-corruption Layer can be extensively tested to ensure correct translation, validation, and handling of data from external systems.

## Demo

You can download the compressed file and extract it. Please install the dependencies using `npm install axios`. You can run the application using `node app.js`. The output will be shown in console.

## Conclusion

The Anti-corruption Layer pattern provides a mechanism to protect the internal system from the corrupting influences of external dependencies, enabling it to maintain a clean architecture and operate independently.
