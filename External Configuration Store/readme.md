# External Configuration Storage Pattern

The External Configuration Storage pattern is a software design pattern that focuses on storing application configuration settings in an external configuration store, separate from the application code. This pattern promotes flexibility, maintainability, and ease of configuration management by allowing dynamic configuration updates without requiring application code changes or restarts.

## Motivation

In traditional software applications, configuration settings are often hard-coded or stored in local configuration files. However, managing and updating these configuration settings can be challenging, especially in large-scale applications or distributed systems. The External Configuration Storage pattern addresses these challenges by decoupling configuration settings from the application code and centralizing them in a dedicated configuration store.

## Key Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Storing configuration settings in an external store allows for dynamic updates without modifying the application code. This enables configuration changes such as scaling resources, adjusting thresholds, or enabling/disabling features, without requiring application restarts or redeployments.

- **Centralized Management**: The pattern enables centralized management of configuration settings, making it easier to maintain and track changes. Configuration updates can be applied uniformly across multiple instances or components of an application, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of configuration drift.

- **Security**: External configuration stores often provide security features like encryption, access controls, and auditing capabilities. This helps protect sensitive configuration data, such as credentials or API keys, from being exposed in application code or configuration files.

- **Separation of Concerns**: Storing configuration settings separately from the application code promotes the separation of concerns. Developers can focus on writing business logic without mixing it with configuration details, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.

## Implementation

The External Configuration Storage pattern can be implemented using various external configuration stores, such as etcd, Consul, ZooKeeper, or cloud-based services like AWS SSM Parameter Store or Azure Key Vault. These stores typically provide APIs or client libraries to interact with the configuration data.

The implementation steps generally involve:

1. **Setting up the external configuration store**: Install and configure the chosen configuration store, ensuring it is accessible to the application.

2. **Updating the application code**: Modify the application code to retrieve configuration settings from the external store instead of hard-coded values or local configuration files. Use the provided client libraries or APIs to fetch the configuration data.

3. **Handling configuration changes**: Implement a mechanism to handle configuration updates in the application. This could involve periodically polling the configuration store for changes, subscribing to change events, or using webhooks or notifications.

4. **Testing and Deployment**: Test the application with different configuration settings and ensure it behaves as expected. Deploy the updated code and verify that configuration changes take effect without requiring application restarts.

## Choosing an External Store Library

When implementing the External Configuration Storage pattern, it is essential to choose a suitable library for interacting with the external configuration store. Consider the following factors when selecting a library:

- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the library supports the chosen external configuration store. Some popular options include etcd, Consul, ZooKeeper, or cloud-based services like AWS SSM Parameter Store or Azure Key Vault.

- **Client Features**: Look for libraries that provide comprehensive client features, such as read and write operations, handling configuration updates, and error handling. Consider libraries that have good documentation and community support.

- **Language Support**: Check if the library supports the programming language used in your application. Libraries are often available for popular languages like Python, Node.js, Java, or Go.

- **Performance and Scalability**: Evaluate the library's performance and scalability capabilities, especially if your application requires frequent configuration updates or operates in a high-traffic environment.

## Running the Python Program

To demonstrate the External Configuration Storage pattern using etcd3 in Python, follow these steps by extracting the compressed file in this repo:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install etcd3
   python app.py
The program will connect to the etcd server, retrieve the configuration value for the specified key path, and print it to the console.

## Conclusion
The External Configuration Storage pattern provides a flexible and scalable approach to managing application configuration settings. By decoupling configuration from the application code, it promotes maintainability and enables dynamic updates without disrupting the application's operation. Adopting this pattern can simplify configuration management and improve the agility of your software systems.
